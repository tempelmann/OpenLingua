Again, the Undo Manager will remember this on its stack,		so that a Redo work almost exactly like an Undo.				How it works with UndoEngine:				User modification:		- Controller calls UndoEngine.Backup() to report a modification, usually before		the modification is performed. A hint can be included.		- UndoEngine calls back the Controller's Backup method which is supposed		to return the data it wants to save for a restore. The above hint is passed in		so that different types of states can be saved easily this way.				Undo:		- UndoEngine calls the Controller's Backup method with the previous hint		value, and the Controller is supposed to return the current state again.		- UndoEngine calls the Controller's RestoreFromBackup method with the previously saved		data, and the Controller uses it to restore the previous state.				Redo:		Same happens as with Undo. I.e, the Controller is not aware of the difference.	#tag EndNote	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected bakP() As Variant	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected busy As Boolean	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected editLabel() As string	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected hint() As Variant	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h21		Private mAwaitingBackupCallP As Integer = -1	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected maxundoP As integer	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h21		Private mNewBackup As Variant	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h21		Private mUndoing As Boolean	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected objP() As Undoable	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected PositionP As integer	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected typeLabel As Variant	#tag EndProperty	#tag ViewBehavior		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Index"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InitialValue="2147483648"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Left"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Name"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Super"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Top"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty	#tag EndViewBehaviorEnd Class#tag EndClass
